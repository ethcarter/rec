#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To write programs using C++ expression evaluation and precedence

---

#### **Theory:**
In C++, expressions are evaluated based on operator precedence and associativity. Precedence decides which operator is executed first, while associativity resolves ties. For example, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

**Key Points:**
- Multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), modulus (`%`) → higher precedence than addition/subtraction.
- Parentheses `()` → highest precedence, evaluated first.  
- Associativity is left-to-right for most arithmetic operators.

#### **Program:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float radius, area;
    cout << "Enter radius of the circle: ";
    cin >> radius;

    area = 3.14 * radius * radius; // expression evaluation with precedence
    cout << "Area of the circle = " << area << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Sample Output:**
```cpp
Enter radius of the circle: 5
Area of the circle = 78.5
```

#### **Conclusion:**
> Successfully implemented a program to calculate the area of a circle using C++ expression evaluation and operator precedence.
