#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To write a program using I/O statements and various operators in C++

---

#### **Theory:**
In C++, input is taken using `cin` and output is displayed using `cout`. Operators such as arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment are used to perform operations on variables.

**Key Points:**
- `cin`: standard input stream.  
- `cout`:  standard output stream.  
- Operators: arithmetic (`+ - * / %`), relational (`== != > <`), logical (`&& || !`), assignment (`=`).  

---

#### **Program:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;

    cout << "Sum = " << a + b << endl;
    cout << "Difference = " << a - b << endl;
    cout << "Product = " << a * b << endl;
    cout << "Quotient = " << a / b << endl;
    cout << "Remainder = " << a % b << endl;

    cout << "Is a equal to b? " << (a == b) << endl;
    cout << "Is a greater than b? " << (a > b) << endl;
    cout << "Logical AND (a>0 && b>0): " << (a > 0 && b > 0) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Sample Output:**
```cpp
Enter two numbers: 10 3
Sum = 13
Difference = 7
Product = 30
Quotient = 3
Remainder = 1
Is a equal to b? 0
Is a greater than b? 1
Logical AND (a>0 && b>0): 1
```

#### **Conclusion:**
A program was successfully implemented to demonstrate the use of input/output statements and different operators in C++.
