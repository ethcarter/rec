---

#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To understand and familiarize with the C++ programming environment, including the use of an editor, compiler, and execution process.

---

#### **Theory:**
> **C++ programs** are written in an editor and converted into machine code using a compiler. The workflow involves editing, compiling, and executing to observe results.

> **Key Points:**
> - **Editor:** write and save source code (`.cpp`).  
> - **Compiler:** translates code into executable form.  
> - **Steps:** Preprocessing → Compilation → Linking → Execution.  

---

#### **Algorithm(OPTIONAL):**
> 1. Open an editor and write a simple C++ program.  
> 2. Save the file with a `.cpp` extension.  
> 3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).  
> 4. Fix any errors if present.  
> 5. Run the generated executable to view the output.  


#### **Program:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World"<< endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Sample Output:**
```cpp
Hello World
```

---

#### **Conclusion:**
> Successfully familiarized with the C++ environment by writing, compiling, and executing a simple program.
