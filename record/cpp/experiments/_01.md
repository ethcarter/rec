---

#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To understand and familiarize with the C++ programming environment, including the use of an editor, compiler, and execution process.

---

#### **Theory:**
**C++ programs** are written in an editor and converted into machine code using a compiler. The workflow involves editing, compiling, and executing to observe results.

**Key Points:**
- **Editor:** write and save source code with `.cpp` file extension.  
- **Compiler:** translates code into executable form.  
- **Steps:** Preprocessing → Compilation → Linking → Execution.  

---

#### **Program:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Sample Output:**
```sh
Hello World
```

---

#### **Conclusion:**
Successfully familiarized with the C++ environment by writing, compiling, and executing a simple program.
