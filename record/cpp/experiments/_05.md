#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To write programs using *Loop* statements in C++

---

#### **Theory:**
**Loops** are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met. C++ provides `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, each suited for different situations.

**Key Points:**
- **for:** → used when the number of iterations is known.  
- **while:** executes while the condition is true, checked before each iteration.  
- **do-while:** → executes at least once, condition checked after execution.

#### **Program:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;

    cout << "Numbers from 1 to " << n << " are:" << endl;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Sample Output:**
```sh
Enter a number: 5
Numbers from 1 to 5 are:
1 2 3 4 5
```

---

#### **Conclusion:**
A program was successfully written to demonstrate loop statements (for, while, do-while) in C++.
