#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To write programs using C++ decision-making statements and branching statements

---

#### **Program:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;

    if (num > 0)
        cout << "The number is Positive" << endl;
    else if (num < 0)
        cout << "The number is Negative" << endl;
    else
        cout << "The number is Zero" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Sample Output:**
```cpp
Enter a number: -5
The number is Negative
```

#### **Conclusion:**
A program was successfully written using decision-making and branching statements in C++.
