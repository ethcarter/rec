# Experiment 7: Decoder

## Aim of the Experiment:
To design, implement, and verify the operation of a 2-to-4 decoder using logic gates.

## Components Required:
- IC 74139 (Dual 2-to-4 decoder)
- IC 7408 (Quad 2-input AND gates)
- IC 7404 (Hex inverter)
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
- 5V DC power supply
- LED indicators
- Toggle switches for inputs
- 330Ω resistors

## Theory:
A decoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary information from n input lines to 2^n unique output lines. When an input combination is present, the decoder activates one specific output line corresponding to the binary value of that input.

A 2-to-4 decoder has:
- 2 input lines (A1, A0)
- 4 output lines (Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3)
- Often includes an Enable input (E)

When enabled (E = 1 for active-high enable or E = 0 for active-low enable), the decoder activates exactly one of its outputs based on the binary value presented at the inputs.

For a 2-to-4 decoder with active-high outputs and active-high enable:
Y0 = E · Ā1 · Ā0
Y1 = E · Ā1 · A0
Y2 = E · A1 · Ā0
Y3 = E · A1 · A0

For a 2-to-4 decoder with active-low outputs and active-low enable:
Y0̄ = Ē + A1 + A0
Y1̄ = Ē + A1 + Ā0
Y2̄ = Ē + Ā1 + A0
Y3̄ = Ē + Ā1 + Ā0

## Truth Table:
### For Active-High Outputs, Active-High Enable:

| E | A1 | A0 | Y0 | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | X  | X  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 1 | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |

### For Active-Low Outputs, Active-Low Enable:

| E | A1 | A0 | Y0̄ | Y1̄ | Y2̄ | Y3̄ |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | X  | X  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
| 0 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
| 0 | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
| 0 | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  |
| 0 | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  |

## Conclusion: (write short conclusion/as you like)
In this experiment, we successfully designed and implemented a 2-to-4 decoder using basic logic gates and verified its operation. The decoder correctly converted binary input codes into their corresponding one-hot output signals, activating exactly one output line for each unique input combination when enabled. Decoders are fundamental building blocks in digital systems, commonly used in memory addressing, instruction decoding in CPUs, data demultiplexing, and display drivers where binary codes need to be converted to individual selection lines.
