#### **Theory:**
- What is a Logic gate?
  - A logic gate is the basic building block of digital circuits that implement Boolean functions.
  - Inputs: `0 = LOW` & `1 = HIGH`
- Types of Logic gates:
  - **AND gate:**
    - Equation: `Y = A • B`
    - Operation: Output is HIGH only when all inputs are HIGH
  - **NAND gate:**
    - Equation: `Y = (A • B)'`
    - Operation: Output is LOW only when all inputs are HIGH
  - **OR gate:**
    - Equation: `Y = A + B`
    - Operation: Output is HIGH only when atleast one input is HIGH
  - **NOR gate:**
    - Equation: `Y = (A + B)'`
    - Operation: Output is HIGH only when all inputs are LOW
  - **NOT gate:**
    - Equation: `Y = A'`
    - Operation: Output is the complement of the input
  - **XOR gate:**
    - Equation: `Y = (A' • B) + (A • B')`
    - Operation: Output is HIGH when inputs are different
  - **X-NOR gate:**
    - Equation: `Y = (A • B) + (A' • B')`
    - Operation: Output is HIGH only when all inputs are HIGH

#### **Procedure:**
- Connect the power supply to the ICs
- For each logic gate, perform the following steps:
  - Identify input and output pins from the IC datasheet.
  - Connect input pins to toggle switches or logic sources.
  - Connect output pins to LED indicators or logic probes.
  - Apply different input combinations according to the truth table.
  - Observe and record the output for each input combination.
  - Compare the observed outputs with the theoretical truth table.
- Repeat the procedure for all seven types of logic gates.

#### **Calculation:**
For verification using Boolean algebra:
- **AND gate:** A · B = 1 · 1 = 1; A · B = 1 · 0 = 0
- **OR gate:** A + B = 0 + 0 = 0; A + B = 0 + 1 = 1
- **NOT gate:** Ā = not(1) = 0; Ā = not(0) = 1
- **NAND gate:** (A · B)' = (1 · 1)' = 1' = 0
- **NOR gate:** (A + B)' = (0 + 0)' = 0' = 1
- **XOR gate:** A ⊕ B = 1 ⊕ 1 = 0; A ⊕ B = 1 ⊕ 0 = 1
- **XNOR gate:** A ⊙ B = 1 ⊙ 1 = 1; A ⊙ B = 1 ⊙ 0 = 0

The experimental results successfully verified the truth tables of all seven logic gates, confirming their fundamental Boolean logic operations.
