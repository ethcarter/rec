#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To study and verify the truth table of **half-subtractor** and **full-subtractor**

---

#### **Components Required:**
- XOR gate (IC 7846)
- AND (IC 7408)
- NOT (IC 7404)
- OR (IC 7432)
- Digital trainer kit
- Connecting wires
- 5V DC power supply

---

#### **Theory:**
- **Half-subtractor:**
  - A combinational logic circuit that subtracts two single binary digits and produces a ***difference bit(D)*** and a ***borrow bit(B)***
  - **Equation:**
    - `D = A XOR B`
    - `B = A' â€¢ B`

- **Full-subtractor:**
  - A combinational logic circuit that subtracts three inputs(A, B and Bin) and produces a ***difference bit(D)*** and a ***borrow-out bit(Bout)***
  - **Equation:**
    - `D = A XOR B XOR C`
    - `Bout = A'B + A Bin + B Bin`

#### **Truth Tables:**
- **Half-subtractor**

| A | B | Diff | Borrow |
| - | - | ---- | ------ |
| 0 | 0 | 0    | 0      |
| 0 | 1 | 1    | 1      |
| 1 | 0 | 1    | 0      |

| 0 | 0 | 1   | 1    | 1      |
| 0 | 1 | 0   | 1    | 1      |
| 0 | 1 | 1   | 0    | 1      |
| 1 | 0 | 0   | 1    | 0      |
| 1 | 0 | 1   | 0    | 0      |
| 1 | 1 | 0   | 0    | 0      |
| 1 | 1 | 1   | 1    | 1      |
