# Experiment 5: Demultiplexer

## Aim of the Experiment:
To design, implement, and verify the operation of a 1×4 demultiplexer using logic gates.

## Components Required:
- IC 74155 (Dual 1-to-4 demultiplexer)
- IC 7408 (Quad 2-input AND gates)
- IC 7404 (Hex inverter)
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
- 5V DC power supply
- LED indicators
- Toggle switches for inputs
- 330Ω resistors

## Theory:
A demultiplexer (DEMUX) performs the opposite function of a multiplexer. It takes a single input and routes it to one of several outputs based on the values of selection lines. It is also known as a data distributor.

A 1×4 demultiplexer has:
- 1 data input line (D)
- 2 selection lines (S0, S1)
- 4 output lines (Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3)

The selection lines determine which output receives the input data. For example:
- When S1S0 = 00, input D goes to output Y0
- When S1S0 = 01, input D goes to output Y1
- When S1S0 = 10, input D goes to output Y2
- When S1S0 = 11, input D goes to output Y3

The Boolean expressions for a 1×4 DEMUX outputs are:
Y0 = D · S̄1 · S̄0
Y1 = D · S̄1 · S0
Y2 = D · S1 · S̄0
Y3 = D · S1 · S0

## Truth Table:

| D | S1 | S0 | Y0 | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | X  | X  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 1 | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |

## Conclusion: (write short conclusion/as you like)
In this experiment, we successfully designed and implemented a 1×4 demultiplexer using basic logic gates and verified its operation. The demultiplexer correctly distributed the single input to one of four outputs based on the selection inputs. This circuit demonstrates the fundamental principle of data distribution in digital systems, which is essential in applications like memory addressing, serial-to-parallel conversion, and control signal distribution where a single data stream needs to be directed to multiple destinations.
