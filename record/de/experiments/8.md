- IC 7474 (Dual D flip-flops)
- IC 7400 (Quad 2-input NAND gates)
- IC 7402 (Quad 2-input NOR gates)
- IC 7404 (Hex inverter)
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
- 5V DC power supply
- LED indicators
- Toggle switches for inputs
- Push button for clock
- 330Œ© resistors
- 0.1ŒºF capacitor (for clock debouncing)

## Theory:
Flip-flops are sequential logic circuits that can store binary information. They are the fundamental building blocks of digital memory and serve as storage elements in sequential logic circuits. Unlike combinational circuits, flip-flops have memory and their outputs depend not only on current inputs but also on previous states.

### Types of Flip-Flops:

1. **SR (Set-Reset) Flip-Flop:**
   - Inputs: Set (S) and Reset (R)
   - Outputs: Q and QÃÑ
   - Function: Sets (Q=1) or resets (Q=0) based on inputs
   - When S=1, R=0: Q=1 (Set state)
   - When S=0, R=1: Q=0 (Reset state)
   - When S=0, R=0: No change (memory state)
   - When S=1, R=1: Invalid/forbidden state

2. **JK Flip-Flop:**
   - Inputs: J (set), K (reset), and Clock
   - Outputs: Q and QÃÑ
   - Function: Enhanced version of SR flip-flop that resolves the invalid state
   - When J=0, K=0: No change
   - When J=0, K=1: Reset (Q=0)
   - When J=1, K=0: Set (Q=1)
   - When J=1, K=1: Toggle (Q changes to QÃÑ)

3. **D (Data/Delay) Flip-Flop:**
   - Inputs: D (data) and Clock
   - Outputs: Q and QÃÑ
   - Function: Stores the value of D input at the rising/falling edge of the clock
   - When Clock triggers: Q takes the value of D

4. **T (Toggle) Flip-Flop:**
   - Inputs: T (toggle) and Clock
   - Outputs: Q and QÃÑ
   - Function: Toggles its state when T=1, maintains state when T=0
   - When T=0: No change
   - When T=1: Q changes to QÃÑ (toggles)

## Truth Tables:

### SR Flip-Flop:
| S | R | Q | QÃÑ | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|--------------------|
| 0 | 0 | Q | QÃÑ | Memory (no change) |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Reset |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Set |
| 1 | 1 | ? | ? | Invalid (unpredictable) |

### JK Flip-Flop:
| J | K | Q(next) | Comment |
|---|---|---------|--------------|
| 0 | 0 | Q      | No change |
| 0 | 1 | 0      | Reset |
| 1 | 0 | 1      | Set |
| 1 | 1 | QÃÑ      | Toggle |

### D Flip-Flop:
| D | Q(next) | Comment |
|---|---------|---------|
| 0 | 0      | Reset |
| 1 | 1      | Set |

### T Flip-Flop:
| T | Q(next) | Comment |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 0 | Q      | No change |
| 1 | QÃÑ      | Toggle |

## Conclusion: (write short conclusion/as you like)
In this experiment, we successfully designed, implemented, and verified the operation of various types of flip-flops (SR, JK, D, and T). We observed how each flip-flop responds to different input combinations and how they store binary information. Flip-flops are essential components in digital electronics, serving as memory elements in registers, counters, and state machines. Understanding their behavior is crucial for designing sequential circuits and synchronous systems. The experiment demonstrated the fundamental principles of binary storage and state transitions in digital sequential circuits.
