# Experiment 9: Counter

## Aim of the Experiment:
To design, implement, and verify the operation of a 4-bit binary up counter using JK flip-flops.

## Components Required:
- IC 7476 (Dual JK flip-flops) - 2 pieces
- IC 7404 (Hex inverter)
- IC 7408 (Quad 2-input AND gates)
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
- 5V DC power supply
- LED indicators
- Push button for manual clock
- Toggle switch for reset
- 330Œ© resistors
- 0.1ŒºF capacitor (for clock debouncing)

## Theory:
A counter is a sequential circuit that goes through a predetermined sequence of states upon the application of clock pulses. Counters are widely used in digital systems for counting events, creating timing delays, and generating control sequences.

A binary up counter counts upward in a binary sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). Each flip-flop in the counter represents one bit of the binary number, with the least significant bit (LSB) changing state with each clock pulse.

For a 4-bit binary up counter:
- It consists of 4 flip-flops (commonly JK flip-flops with J=K=1 for toggle functionality)
- Counts from 0000 (0) to 1111 (15) and then wraps around
- The LSB toggles with every clock pulse
- Each subsequent bit toggles when all previous bits are 1 and change to 0

In a ripple counter design (asynchronous counter):
- The output of each flip-flop serves as the clock input for the next flip-flop
- Only the first flip-flop is clocked by the external clock
- Each bit toggles when the previous bit changes from 1 to 0

In a synchronous counter design:
- All flip-flops are clocked simultaneously by the external clock
- Logic gates determine when each flip-flop should toggle
- Each bit toggles when all previous bits are 1 (for an up counter)

### Design Equations for 4-bit Synchronous Up Counter:
- FF0 (LSB): Toggle on every clock (J0=K0=1)
- FF1: Toggle when Q0=1 (J1=K1=Q0)
- FF2: Toggle when Q0=Q1=1 (J2=K2=Q0¬∑Q1)
- FF3 (MSB): Toggle when Q0=Q1=Q2=1 (J3=K3=Q0¬∑Q1¬∑Q2)

## Truth Table:
### 4-bit Binary Up Counter Sequence:

| Count | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 | Q0 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|
| 0     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
| 2     | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 3     | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
| 4     | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 5     | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  |
| 6     | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| 7     | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
| 8     | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 9     | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
| 10    | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 11    | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
| 12    | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 13    | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  |
| 14    | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| 15    | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
| 0     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |

## Conclusion: (write short conclusion/as you like)
In this experiment, we successfully designed, implemented, and verified the operation of a 4-bit binary up counter using JK flip-flops. The counter correctly progressed through all 16 states (0-15) before wrapping around to 0 again. We observed how each bit in the counter changes according to the binary counting principles, with the least significant bit toggling at every clock pulse and each subsequent bit toggling when all previous bits are 1.

This experiment demonstrates the fundamental principles of sequential circuits and binary counting systems. Counters are essential components in digital systems, used in applications such as frequency dividers, timers, address generators in memory systems, and various control sequences in digital systems. Understanding counter design provides insights into more complex sequential circuit design and system timing control.
