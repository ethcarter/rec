# Experiment 6: Encoder

## Aim of the Experiment:
To design, implement, and verify the operation of a 4-to-2 priority encoder using logic gates.

## Components Required:
- IC 74148 (8-to-3 priority encoder, can be used partially)
- IC 7432 (Quad 2-input OR gates)
- IC 7404 (Hex inverter)
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
- 5V DC power supply
- LED indicators
- Push buttons or toggle switches for inputs
- 330Œ© resistors

## Theory:
An encoder is a combinational circuit that converts information from one format to another. Specifically, a digital encoder converts an active input signal into a coded output signal. A 4-to-2 encoder takes 4 input lines and produces a 2-bit binary code representing which input line is active.

A priority encoder also establishes the priority of inputs when more than one input is active simultaneously. In a 4-to-2 priority encoder, input D3 has the highest priority, followed by D2, D1, and D0.

For a 4-to-2 priority encoder:
- Inputs: D0, D1, D2, D3 (active-high)
- Outputs: A1, A0 (binary code)

The binary output represents the highest-priority active input.

The Boolean expressions for a 4-to-2 priority encoder are:
A1 = D2 + D3
A0 = D1 + D3

Some encoders also include a Valid Output (V) signal that indicates when at least one input is active:
V = D0 + D1 + D2 + D3

## Truth Table:

| D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 | A1 | A0 | V |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | x  | x  | 0 |
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1 |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | x  | 0  | 1  | 1 |
| 0  | 1  | x  | x  | 1  | 0  | 1 |
| 1  | x  | x  | x  | 1  | 1  | 1 |

Where 'x' represents "don't care" condition

## Conclusion: (write short conclusion/as you like)
In this experiment, we successfully designed and implemented a 4-to-2 priority encoder using basic logic gates and verified its operation. The encoder correctly converted active input signals into their corresponding binary codes, with proper prioritization when multiple inputs were active simultaneously. Priority encoders are vital components in digital systems where input precedence needs to be established, such as in interrupt handling circuits, keyboard encoders, and other systems where multiple input sources require prioritized processing.
