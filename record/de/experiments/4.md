# Experiment 4: Multiplexer

## Aim of the Experiment:
To design, implement, and verify the operation of a 4×1 multiplexer using logic gates.

## Components Required:
- IC 74153 (Dual 4-to-1 multiplexer)
- IC 7408 (Quad 2-input AND gates)
- IC 7432 (Quad 2-input OR gates)
- IC 7404 (Hex inverter)
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
- 5V DC power supply
- LED indicators
- Toggle switches for inputs
- 330Ω resistors

## Theory:
A multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational circuit that selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a single output line. It is also called a data selector since it selects one of many data inputs and directs it to the output.

A 4×1 multiplexer has:
- 4 data input lines (I0, I1, I2, I3)
- 2 selection lines (S0, S1)
- 1 output line (Y)

The selection lines determine which input is connected to the output. For example:
- When S1S0 = 00, input I0 is selected
- When S1S0 = 01, input I1 is selected
- When S1S0 = 10, input I2 is selected
- When S1S0 = 11, input I3 is selected

The Boolean expression for a 4×1 MUX is:
Y = (I0 · S̄1 · S̄0) + (I1 · S̄1 · S0) + (I2 · S1 · S̄0) + (I3 · S1 · S0)

## Truth Table:

| S1 | S0 | Output Y |
|----|----|---------:|
| 0  | 0  | I0       |
| 0  | 1  | I1       |
| 1  | 0  | I2       |
| 1  | 1  | I3       |

## Conclusion: (write short conclusion/as you like)
In this experiment, we successfully designed and implemented a 4×1 multiplexer using basic logic gates and verified its operation. The multiplexer correctly selected one of four input signals based on the selection inputs and forwarded it to the output. This circuit demonstrates the fundamental principle of data selection in digital systems, which is essential in applications like data routing, communication systems, and arithmetic logic units where selective data transmission is required.
