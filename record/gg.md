# Sensors & Transducers

## Principles (1 mark)
Sensors detect physical quantities and convert them into measurable signals, while transducers convert one form of energy into another. They work on principles like resistive, capacitive, inductive, piezoelectric, thermoelectric, photoelectric, and electromagnetic effects to transform physical parameters into electrical signals.

## Classification (1 mark)
Sensors are classified as: **Active** (self-generating, no external power) and **Passive** (require external power); **Analog** (continuous output) and **Digital** (discrete output); **Contact** and **Non-contact** types based on physical interaction with the measured quantity.

## Characteristics - Static and Dynamic (5 marks)

**Static Characteristics:**
- **Accuracy**: Closeness of measured value to true value
- **Precision**: Repeatability of measurements under same conditions
- **Sensitivity**: Ratio of output change to input change
- **Resolution**: Smallest detectable input change
- **Linearity**: Deviation from ideal straight-line response
- **Hysteresis**: Difference in output for increasing and decreasing inputs

**Dynamic Characteristics:**
- **Fidelity**: Ability to reproduce input waveform without distortion in output
- **Response Time**: Time taken to reach final steady value after input change (includes rise time, settling time)
- **Time Constant**: Time to reach 63.2% of final value in first-order systems
- **Frequency Response**: Sensor behavior over range of input frequencies

## PP (1-5) - Assuming Performance Parameters (5 marks)
- **Span/Range**: Difference between maximum and minimum measurable values
- **Threshold**: Minimum input required to produce detectable output change
- **Drift**: Gradual change in output over time with constant input (temporal or thermal drift)
- **Noise**: Random fluctuations in output signal affecting measurement quality
- **Dead Band**: Range of input where no output change occurs

## Environmental Parameters (1 mark)
Environmental parameters include temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, vibration, and electromagnetic interference that affect sensor operation. Sensors must be compensated or shielded against these external factors to maintain accuracy and reliability.
