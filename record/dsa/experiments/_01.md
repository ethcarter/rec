#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To write a program to analyze the concept and importance of data structures

---

#### **Theory:**
Data structures define the systematic way of organizing and storing data so that it can be used efficiently. They form the foundation of algorithms and problem-solving in computer science.

- **Primitive data structures:** int, float, char, etc.

- **Non-primitive data structures:** arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs.

**Efficiency:** The choice of data structure determines the time and space complexity of operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

**Applications:** Used in compilers, operating systems, databases, artificial intelligence, and networks.

#### **Program:**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[10], n = 5;

    // Initial Insertion
    cout << "Inserting elements...\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = (i + 1) * 10; // 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
    }

    // Traversal
    cout << "Array elements: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cout << arr[i] << " ";
    cout << "\n";

    // Searching
    int key = 30, found = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            found = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (found != -1) cout << "Element " << key << " found at index " << found << "\n";
    else cout << "Element not found\n";

    // Deletion
    int del = 20;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == del) {
            for (int j = i; j < n - 1; j++) arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
            n--; // reduce size
            break;
        }
    }

    // Traversal after deletion
    cout << "Array after deleting " << del << ": ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cout << arr[i] << " ";
    cout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Sample Output:**
```sh
Inserting elements...
Array elements: 10 20 30 40 50 
Element 30 found at index 2
Array after deleting 20: 10 30 40 50
```

---

#### **Conclusion:**
- The program demonstrates basic array operations â€” insertion, traversal, searching, and deletion.
- The analysis shows that arrays provide efficient traversal and random access, but insertion and deletion require shifting elements, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.
