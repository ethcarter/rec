#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To implement singly linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

---

#### **Theory:**
A singly linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are connected sequentially using pointers. Each node contains two parts:
- Data: The value stored in the node.
- Pointer (next): Address of the next node in the sequence.

**Key operations:**
  - Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or specific position.
  - Deletion: Removing a node from the beginning, end, or specific position.
  - Traversal: Visiting each node sequentially to access or display data.

**Advantages:**
  - Dynamic memory allocation.
  - Efficient insertion and deletion compared to arrays.

**Limitations:**
  - No random access; traversal is O(n).
  - Extra memory required for storing pointers.

#### **Program:**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(NULL) {}
};

class SinglyLinkedList {
    Node* head;
public:
    SinglyLinkedList() : head(NULL) {}

    // Insert at end
    void insert(int val) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(val);
        if (!head) {
            head = newNode;
            return;
        }
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp->next) temp = temp->next;
        temp->next = newNode;
    }

    // Delete by value
    void deleteNode(int val) {
        if (!head) return;
        if (head->data == val) {
            Node* temp = head;
            head = head->next;
            delete temp;
            return;
        }
        Node* curr = head;
        while (curr->next && curr->next->data != val)
            curr = curr->next;
        if (curr->next) {
            Node* temp = curr->next;
            curr->next = curr->next->next;
            delete temp;
        }
    }

    // Traversal
    void traverse() {
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp) {
            cout << temp->data << " -> ";
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        cout << "NULL\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    SinglyLinkedList list;
    list.insert(10);
    list.insert(20);
    list.insert(30);

    cout << "List after insertion: ";
    list.traverse();

    list.deleteNode(20);
    cout << "List after deleting 20: ";
    list.traverse();

    return 0;
}
```

---

#### **Sample Output:**
```cpp
List after insertion: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL
List after deleting 20: 10 -> 30 -> NULL
```

---

#### **Conclusion:**
- Singly linked list operations were successfully implemented.
- Insertion allows dynamic growth of the list.
- Deletion removes specific nodes efficiently without shifting elements.
- Traversal provides sequential access to all elements.
