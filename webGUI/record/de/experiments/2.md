#### **Aim of the experiment:**
> To study and verify the truth table of **half adder** and **full-adder**

---

#### **Components Required:**
- XOR gate (IC 7486)
- AND gate (IC 7408)
- OR gate (IC 7432)
- Digital trainer kit
- Connecting wires
- 5V DC power supply

---

#### **Theory:**
- **Half-adder:**
  - A combinational logic circuit that adds two single binary digits and produces sum bit(S) and carry bit(C) as outputs.
  - **Equations:**
    - `S = A XOR B`
    - `C = A • B`
- **Full-adder:**
  - A combinational logic circuit that adds three binary digits(two input bits and a carry-in) and produces a sum bit(S) and a carry-out bit(Cin) as outputs.
  - **Equations:**
    - `S = A XOR B XOR Cin`
    - `Cout = (A • B) + (Cin • (A XOR B))`

#### **Truth Tables:**
- **Half-adder:**

| A | B | Sum | Carry |
| - | - | --- | ----- |
| 0 | 0 | 0   | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1   | 0     |
| 1 | 0 | 1   | 0     |
| 1 | 1 | 0   | 1     |

- **Full-adder:**

| A | B | Cin | Sum | Cout |
| - | - | --- | --- | ---- |
| 0 | 0 | 0   | 0   | 0    |
| 0 | 0 | 1   | 1   | 0    |
| 0 | 1 | 0   | 1   | 0    |
| 0 | 1 | 1   | 0   | 1    |
| 1 | 0 | 0   | 1   | 0    |
| 1 | 0 | 1   | 0   | 1    |
| 1 | 1 | 0   | 0   | 1    |
| 1 | 1 | 1   | 1   | 1    |
